---------------------------------------------------------------

- STEPS REQUIRED BEFORE COMPILATION (SETUP OF OMNIS API)
---------------------------------------------------------------

1) Ensure that you have the appropriate development environment installed
     Windows = Visual Studio 2008
         Mac = XCode 3.2+

2) Ensure that you are using Omnis Studio 5+ (This component is Unicode only)
   a) (Mac Only) Ensure that the application path bundle name has no spaces.  e.g. /Applications/OmnisStudio5.app
   b) (Windows Only) Ensure that the path to the omnis.exe does not have any spaces (So don't put in "Program Files").  e.g C:\TigerLogic\OS50\omnis.exe

3) (Mac only) Ensure that omnisrc.app has been copied (or symbolically linked) into /Developer/Tools.

4) Ensure that this directory is contained in folders with no spaces
      e.g Windows = C:\Externals\MyProjects
              Mac = /Externals/MyProjects

5) Ensure that you set the Installation directory for the component and the path used for omnis libraries
      Windows: a) Right-click on My Computer
               b) Click 'Advanced' tab or 'Advanced System Settings'
               c) Click 'Environment Variables'
               d) Under 'System Variables' click 'New…"
               e) Variable name = OMNIS_XCOMP_PATH
               f) Variable value is the path to the xcomp directory in the Omnis directory
                   NOTE:  There can be no spaces in the path (See Step 2)
                    e.g C:\TigerLogic\OS501\xcomp
	       g) Under 'System Variables' click 'New…"
               h) Variable name = OMNIS_LIB_PATH
               i) Variable value is the path to the Omnis library dependencies.  
                  The folder specified should contain the COMPLIB, EXTLIB and ULIBS folders from the API.
                   NOTE:  There can be no spaces in the path (See Step 2)
                    e.g C:\Externals\OmnisDependencies\Windows
               j) If Visual Studio is open, close and re-open it.


         Mac:  a) Select 'Go' menu in Finder
               b) Select 'Go to Folder'
               c) Type ~/.MacOSX/
                    NOTE: Create the .MacOSX folder if it doesn't exist
               d) Open environment.plist 
                    NOTE: If it doesn't exist then it can be created using the Property List Editor application in /Developer/Applications/Utilities
               e) Click the 'Root' dictionary line
               f) Click the 'Add Child' toolbar button
               g) Key = OMNIS_XCOMP_PATH
               h) Type = String
               i) Value = Path to the xcomp directory in the Omnis application package
                  NOTE: There can be no spaces in the path (See Step 2)
                  e.g /Applications/OmnisStudio5.app/Contents/MacOS/xcomp
               j) Click the 'Root' dictionary line
               k) Click the 'Add Child' toolbar button
               l) Key = OMNIS_LIB_PATH
               m) Type = String
               n) Value = Path to the Omnis library dependencies.  
                  The folder specified should contain the compile and frameworks folders from the API.
                  NOTE: There can be no spaces in the path (See Step 2)
                  e.g \Externals\OmnisDependencies\Mac
               o) Log off of OS X and log back in 

---------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL -- BOOST LIBRARIES
---------------------------------------------------------------
5a) Some projects may also require the Boost libraries, this requires downloading Boost(http://www.boost.org) extracting it to a directory and setting up the $BOOST_ROOT environment variable.  (Boost Getting Started: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/more/getting_started/index.html)
      Windows: a) Right-click on My Computer
               b) Click 'Advanced' tab or 'Advanced System Settings'
               c) Click 'Environment Variables'
               d) Under 'System Variables' click 'New…"
               e) Variable name = BOOST_ROOT
               f) Variable value is the path to the Boost directory
                   NOTE:  There can be no spaces in the path (See Step 2)
                    e.g C:\Boost\boost_1_44_0  (For Version 1.44, the current version at time of writing)
               g) If Visual Studio is open, close and re-open it.


         Mac:  a) Select 'Go' menu in Finder
               b) Select 'Go to Folder'
               c) Type ~/.MacOSX/
                    NOTE: Create the .MacOSX folder if it doesn't exist
               d) Open environment.plist 
                    NOTE: If it doesn't exist then it can be created using the Property List Editor application in /Developer/Applications/Utilities
               e) Click the 'Root' dictionary line
               f) Click the 'Add Child' toolbar button
               g) Key = BOOST_ROOT
               h) Type = String
               i) Value = Path to the Boost directory
                  NOTE: There can be no spaces in the path (See Step 2)
                  e.g /Boost/boost_1_44_0  (For Version 1.44, the current version at time of writing)
               f) Log off of OS X and log back in 

5b) Some projects may also require Boost libraries to be built.  To build boost libraries you must go to the boost directory and execute bjam commands or install the libraries from an installer.  The commands are to be executed from the same directory as $BOOST_ROOT from 5a.  NOTE: All projects assume this builds libraries into $BOOST_ROOT/stage/lib
     Windows: Install libraries from installer (easiest)
		
              -or-

               Complete:
	       bjam -a --layout=versioned --build-type=complete

	       Regular:
	       bjam -a --layout=versioned

	       Complete - Static:
	       bjam -a --layout=versioned --build-type=complete link=static

	       Regular - Static:
	       bjam -a --layout=versioned link=static


         Mac:  Complete:
	       ./bjam -a --layout=versioned --build-type=complete toolset=darwin  architecture=combined address-model=32_64 macosx-version=10.5 macosx-version-min=10.4

	       Regular:
	       ./bjam -a --layout=versioned toolset=darwin architecture=combined address-model=32_64 macosx-version=10.5 macosx-version-min=10.4

	       Complete - Static:
	       ./bjam -a --layout=versioned --build-type=complete toolset=darwin  link=static architecture=combined address-model=32_64 macosx-version=10.5 macosx-version-min=10.4

	       Regular - Static:
	       ./bjam -a --layout=versioned toolset=darwin link=static architecture=combined address-model=32_64 macosx-version=10.5 macosx-version-min=10.4

---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------


6) Ensure that the Omnis executable has been set so 'Build and Run' can be used
     Windows: a) Open Visual Studio 2008 project NVObjTemplate.vcprog
              b) Go to 'Debug' menu
              c) Select 'Start Debugging'
              d) A window will appear asking to find the executable
              e) Enter the executable path
              f) Click OK
              g) A window may appear saying that the executable does not have debug information - that is ok, dismiss the message.

         Mac: a) Open XCode project NVObjTemplate.xcodeproj
              b) Locate "Omnis" under "Executables"
              c) Right-Click on "Omnis" and select "Get Info"
              d) Change "Path" to the path of the Omnis Studio application bundle
                    e.g /Applications/OmnisStudio5.app

7) Attempt to compile the project
     Windows: NOTE -- If you did step 6 then the project has already been compiled and Omnis opened, but the steps are here for completeness.
              a) Open Visual Studio 2008 project NVObjTemplate.vcprog
              b) Go to 'Build' menu -or- Go to 'Debug' menu
              c) Select 'Build Solution' -or- Select 'Start Debugging' to compile component and open Omnis

         Mac: a) Open XCode project NVObjTemplate.xcodeproj
              b) Go to 'Build' menu
              c) Select 'Build Results' -or- 'Build and Debug' to compile component and open Omnis
